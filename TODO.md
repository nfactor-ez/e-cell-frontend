# TODO

## 1. Branching & Versioning

- [ ] Create 2 separate branches for new features/changes.
- [ ] Implement tagging strategy: tag old code/features as `old` once done.
- [ ] Figure out history for the 2 branches (how to merge or maintain separate histories).

## 2. Deployment

- [ ] Decide on deployment strategy:
    - [ ] CI/CD pipeline (automatic deployment on push/merge)
    - [ ] Vercel Hook deployment triggered on push to `main`
- [ ] Implement chosen deployment approach.
